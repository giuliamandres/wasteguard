# Wasteguard

Wasteguard is a mobile app for iOS users which aims at diminishing the food waste, focusing on households, where a significant amount of food goes to waste every day, from leftovers forgotten in the back of the fridge to lack of attention on the expiration date. 

The application is easy to use, with an intuitive user interface and features which provide to the user the opportunity to keep track of the products stored in the kitchen and efficiently manage inventory. Furthermore, it offers a recipe recommendation feature based on available ingredients, encouraging users to utilize what they have on hand and reduce the likelihood of food going to waste.
